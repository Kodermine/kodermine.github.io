Hello Kodermine,

We have been inactive for some time in the case for making videos or having live meetups. 
You know how it is life gets busy people have
babies and ETC. So we pretty much evolved into a small community of developers that talk tech and help eachother out.
Maybe sometime in the future we will get back to making videos and doing some live meetups.  
Until then feel free to join our growing group on of developers on Facebook.

Cheers!
