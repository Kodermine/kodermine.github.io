excerpt: "Ruby is a programming language created by an <i>awesome</i> Programmer from Japan named <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto'>Yukihiro Matusumoto (or Matz)</a>. He had a vision of creating a scripting language that was more powerful than pearl and more object oriented than python. He wanted to make the language human readable and often said 'natural, not simple' in a way that it mirrors life."

  def publish
    puts 'post published'
  end

end

```
